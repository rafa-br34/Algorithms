## Adding an algorithm
To add an algorithm, create a pull request with the algorithm, but please follow these guidelines:
+ The algorithm should be anything that has a use in the field of data science, computer science, mathematics, or related(this includes data formats/types and protocols).
+ The algorithm needs to be clearly defined and possibly have legible pseudo-code or implementations(good quality illustrations are also welcome).
+ If you know of the algorithm's original name, please name it appropriately (this also applies to anything other than algorithms).
+ The algorithm should at least include the required files and possibly more.
+ The algorithm should be an implementation that primarily runs on native code and should *not* use an external library for most of its work(in short, your implementation shouldn't be a wrapper for another library).

## Required files/format
+ **About**: This file should include a description of the algorithm, tags, creator, sources(if any), what it does, and more.
+ **Algorithm**: The "Algorithm" can be a Markdown file or a folder(depending on your preference or the algorithm's complexity).
+ **Assets**: The "Assets" folder is an optional folder which should contain assets that the description uses.
+ **Implementations**: The "Implementations" folder should contain implementations for the algorithm (if any), which can be in Markdown or raw source format.
